# Devops-SwiggyAppClone-Terraform

**Overview**
In this project, I am using terraform to create ec2 instance. While creating ec2 I also addes shell script to install jdk,jenkins,docker,sonarcube,trivy. Then I configure sonarcube with jenkisn dashboard and use jenkins pipeline script to deploy application on EKS cluster. For that I integrate kubernetes pluginswith jenkins to deploy.

In this repo I attached clear documentation to implement this project.
